# Black Allium
Update your Google Calendar remotely while using Obsidian through Black Allium. 

It easy to go to Calendar and update it, but its easier to do in while using obsidian tasks.
Why bother switching applications from note taking when you can just do it one swoop?

## Sidenote:
This is just a personal project to keep track my web-development journey and extend my capabilities, and as a useful tool to use for my daily needs.
